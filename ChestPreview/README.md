# Chest Preview
Chest Preview provides a preview of a chest's items without opening the chest.

## Requirements:
- Stardew Valley 1.5.6
- [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) 3.15.0

## Mod Authors:
If your custom items don't use the vanilla spritesheet, you should use the API (link) to add your item's parentsheetindex to it. 
With this i will be able to target your custom drawInMenu function. 
Still, they might be miss aligned. Solving this is on the other mods responsability. 
For it you can use the other method in the API. You'll have to provide a drawInMenuPreview function (a copy of drawInMenu) to the API. And then change values on your function to align your items in the preview.
