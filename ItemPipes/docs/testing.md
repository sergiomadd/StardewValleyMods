This page is for people that want to help testing the mod while it is in beta stage.

## What to look for?
When testing the mod, try play like you normally would, come from mining and try sorting your items. See if any are missing or missplaced.
Also look for mod incompatibilities.

---

## How to report bugs?
You should try reporting your problem in this order.
1) Create a new issue on this github page. Add the Item Pipes label, try explain the problem and a way to replicate it.
2) If you are not familiar with github, ping me (@sergiomadd#5168) on the Stardew Valley discord with you issue.
3) If I don't answer in a few days I might be offline of discord. Then you can send a DM to this twitter account (@) and I will read the issue when I have free time.
